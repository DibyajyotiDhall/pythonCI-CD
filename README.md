## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up and running the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A Jenkins server properly configured and accessible.
- Docker installed on the Jenkins server to support containerization.
- Credentials and access to the target deployment environment (e.g., GITHUB, DOCKERHUB).

### Installation

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking this repository into your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pythonCI-CD.git
   ```

3. **Configure Jenkins:** Set up Jenkins according to your environment and requirements. Install necessary plugins, configure agents like gitplugin,dockerplugin, and set up credentials as needed.

4. **Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job:**

   - Create a new Jenkins pipeline job and configure it to use the Jenkinsfile in the repository.
   - Add the necessary credentials and adjust job settings to match your project.

## Usage

1. **Push to the Repository:** To trigger the Jenkins pipeline, simply push changes to this repository. Jenkins is configured to listen for changes (e.g., commits or pull requests) and will automatically start the pipeline on each change.using "Git-WebHook"

2. **Monitor the Pipeline:** You can monitor the status of the pipeline by accessing the Jenkins server or checking the job in the Jenkins web interface. The pipeline's build, test, and deployment stages will be executed automatically.

3. **View Pipeline Logs:** View the detailed logs for each pipeline run to identify any issues or failures. These logs can help troubleshoot and diagnose problems in the CI/CD process.

## Pipeline Stages

This Jenkins CI/CD pipeline is organized into the following stages:

1. **Checkout:** Checks out the project's source code from the repository.

2. **Build:** Builds the Docker image for the application.

3. **Push to Docker Hub:** Pushes the Docker image to a Docker Hub registry.

4. **Deploy:** Deploys the application to a target environment (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, etc.).
